                I scrolling through my discord and
                came across a picture of a funny-looking plane. "Slow Stick", it said on the box. And
                the artwork on the box itself was literally just a stick with wings attached. I
                thought it was a joke, but no, it was real!
            </p>
            <p>
                So I started to do some digging and heard about how easy it was to fly. I've never
                flown much RC and it seemed just like the perfect plane for me. Only problem is that
                the shipping costed more than the plane itself... which means if I want one, I'll have
                to make my own ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
            </p>
            <p>
                Since this is my first scratch build, I think it'll be very easy to follow along.
                I'll leave all the things I learned here, even if it seems like common sense. This
                article is aimed towards noobs like myself after all!

                <b>I've posted the files on GrabCad. You'll need to

                like this in the future, it's worth it (and it's free!)

                All this should be avaiable at your local hobby store, tho you can get it at a better price if you order online.
                I did a mix of both and ended up spending somewhere between 60-70$
